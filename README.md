# user-api

This project is a User Management System built with Node.js and SQLite that provides four RESTful API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting user records. It includes validations for user data and preserves history by marking previous entries as inactive during updates. The system is designed for efficient management of user data in an organization.
